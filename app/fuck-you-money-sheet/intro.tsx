              situations or people. Achieving financial independence reduces

              Think small and focus on buying yourself time—time to find a new
              job, start a business, or embark on exciting adventures. The Fuck
              You Money Spreadsheet helps you understand your financial
              parameters and calculate your runway—the time you can afford to
              take off based on your savings and expenses. By tracking your
              expenses and savings, you can uncover the stored time in your
              account. Simply subtract your expenses from your savings to
              determine how long you can sustain yourself without a job. It's a
              straightforward formula that empowers you to make informed
              decisions about your finances and prioritize what truly matters.
