          Introducing the Financial Freedom Spreadsheet: Take Control of Your Financial Independence! Discover the power
          of Financial Freedom—a concept that signifies the ability to make life choices without financial constraints.
          Achieving financial independence reduces stress, provides security, and grants the freedom to choose your
          path. But you don't have to be rich or retire forever to experience it.

          Think small and focus on buying yourself time—time to find a new job, start a business, or embark on exciting
          adventures. The Financial Freedom Spreadsheet helps you understand your financial parameters and calculate
          your runway—the time you can afford to take off based on your savings and expenses. By tracking your expenses
          and savings, you can uncover the stored time in your account. Simply subtract your expenses from your savings
          to determine how long you can sustain yourself without a job. It's a straightforward formula that empowers you
          to make informed decisions about your finances and prioritize what truly matters.
        </p>

          The Financial Freedom Spreadsheet encourages you to lower your expenses and increase your income, offering a
          simple yet effective way to accumulate more time in your account. It aligns with the principles of the FIRE
          movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early), which emphasizes saving and investing to achieve financial
          freedom. With this spreadsheet, you gain awareness of your financial parameters, enabling you to take control
          and work towards increasing your stored time.
        </p>
