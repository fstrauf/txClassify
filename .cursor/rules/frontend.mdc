# Your rule content

- Use Nextjs for all development
- Tailwind for styling
- never store any keys in the codebase. All keys should live in .env files.
- Always think from first principles. Let's solve the root cause of an issue and not apply fixes upon fixes.
- Keep solutions as simple as possible. Let's not boil the ocean but instead get a simple fix for the problem presented.
- no mock data! this is a production application and we can't just return dummy data if it doesn't work.
- don't create documentation or README or .md files unless explicity tasked
- pnpm is the package manager all commands should use pnpm
