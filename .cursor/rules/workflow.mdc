# Simple Workflow of the Python Algo


1. train some transaction names with corresponding catregories. store embeddings in db.
2. categorise new transactions based on trained data, creating embeddings of the new transactions and comparing similarity of the trained. write results back to sheet so that a pair of transaction and category exists.


# Infrastructure
All of this runs on the lowest tiers, so it can happen that they are temporarily paused or need time to wake up.
1. DB runs on neon via prisma
2. Replicate handles the embeddings model
3. Render is where the python service is deployed.
