# Simple Workflow of the Python Algo


Training:
1. Get training data from Google Sheets
2. Process and clean the data
3. Get embeddings via Replicate
4. Store embeddings in Supabase
5. Update status

Classification:
1. Get new transactions from Google Sheets
2. Get embeddings for new transactions
3. Compare with stored embeddings
4. Write results back to sheets


# Infrastructure
All of this runs on the lowest tiers, so it can happen that they are temporarily paused or need time to wake up.
1. DB runs on Supabase
2. Replicate handles the embeddings model
3. Render is where the python service is deployed.
